todo 2009-1-1 Test 2: more counting in different ways
todo 2009-1-1 This exercises "buy", "sell", and "exch" transactions.
todo 2009-1-1 Run "umm test1.dat bal 2009-m-d" for different values of m and d.

todo 2009-1-1 You should see N units of J in account 1, balanced by -N $,
todo 2009-1-1 for each day of January 2009; then in February and the first
todo 2009-1-1 couple of days of March, the J get exchanged for $ again,
todo 2009-1-1 and the positive balance of J and negative balance of $ should
todo 2009-1-1 decrease again, until the account is empty.
todo 2009-1-1 In account 2, units of J are bought in exchange for $, but
todo 2009-1-1 automatically throughout the year: on the Nth day of the year,
todo 2009-1-1 there should be N units of J balanced by -N $.
todo 2009-1-1 Account 3 is the same as account 2, except that each J is
todo 2009-1-1 exchanged for an S on the same day it is bought; thus
todo 2009-1-1 there should be N units of S balanced by -N $. In account 3
todo 2009-1-1 there will be two transactions each day, one showing the
todo 2009-1-1 purchase of 1 unit of J and one showing the exchange of that
todo 2009-1-1 unit of J for 1 unit of S.
