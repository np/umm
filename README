Umm is an extremely minimal command-line program to read a plain-text
ledger file and report balance and other information. Although
minimal, it aims to be able to handle multiple accounts, currencies,
commodities, and securities. It doesn't abolutely force you to use
double-entry bookkeeping, although it tries to make it easy to do so.

Umm has only one dependency outside of a haskell compiler and standard
libraries: in order to support Unicode, it requires the utf8-string
library. I don't know of anything in either umm itself or the
utf8-string library that's specific to ghc, but I have so far only
built it with ghc. I've built it with ghc 6.8.3 on an iMac G3 running
OSX 10.3.9, ghc 6.10.{1,3,4} on an x86 running Ubuntu, and ghc 6.10.3
on an x86 running Windows XP. You should be able to build umm simply
by running

	cabal configure && cabal build

or alternately

	ghc --make -O2 -o umm UMM*.hs

For more information, build umm, then run "umm --help", and read the
output of that. Arguably, that info should be in this file... later.
Then look at the two files sample1.dat and sample2.dat; they are very
simple examples of ledgers.

In the contrib/ subdirectory there is a vim syntax highlighter,
contributed by Nicolas Pouillard -- many thanks!
